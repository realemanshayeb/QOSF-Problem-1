**FIND THE LARGEST NUMBER ALGORITHM** 

This Python function determines which of 2 inputs is larger. 
The algorithm uses controlled-NOT gates to compare the input
integers and binary encoding to represent the input 
integers on a quantum register. It  should be noted that algorithm 
works for all integer inputs because it encodes the input
in binary on the first two registers of qubits and uses the same 
number of qubits for any input size. 

**USAGE**
1. Install Python and Qiskit 
2. Download the 'QOSF Submission 1.py' file 
3. Call the find_the_largest_number function with 2 arguments 
4. The function should return the larger of the 2 integers
